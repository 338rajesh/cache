# Cache

This repository is used as a cache to store notes I have written or collected. These notes are typically prepared after reading new manuscripts, after completion of some technical courses, and after exploratory studies.

> [!WARNING] It is not intended to be a comprehensive collection of notes, but rather a personal repository for my own reference and learning. The content may be incomplete, partially incorrect, or outdated. Please read it with caution and verify the information from original sources when necessary.
